                  I have learnt a lot this week, and we barely even started!
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this course we will be not only learning about how the WWW
                  works, but we will be contributing to it. We will be creating
                  out own " personal hypertext system used for keeping track of
                  personal information on a distributed project” (Berners, 792)
                  AKA creating our own website!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I started off by choosing a reading, in more particular, “Tim
                  Berners-Lee et al. – 1994 – The World Wide Web” I have chosen
                  this one as everything has the WWW at its route, and I wanted
                  to learn more about how its all connected. The first step was
                  starting with GitHub. Fortunately, I have worked with GitHub
                  last year so I did not have to install it for understand how
                  it works as I already did that. Then it clicked to me, after
                  reading the reading just how GitHub perfectly embodies the
                  WWW. “The World-Wide Web (W3) was developed to be a pool of
                  human knowledge, which would allow collaborators in remote
                  sites to share their ideas and all aspects of a common
                  project” (Berners, 792) The second I read this line, GitHub
                  immediately came to mind, and how we will be uploading our
                  thoughts and ideas as a common project onto there, eventually
                  forming our website which will be for everybody to see, and
                  the base of it all starts with HTML, the “common basic
                  language of interchange for hypertext”. (Berners, 795)
                </p>
                <p>
                  Majority of the content within the web consists of HTML so I
                  was very excited to dive deeper and learn it. Upon watching
                  the lecture, I noticed that so far, HTML appeared very easy.
                  It mainly consisted of being the base structure of the
                  website, that includes the menus, lists, contact lists etc,
                  but I realised that HTML was the basics of a much larger
                  picture, it was just the shell of the complicated WWW I am
                  really looking forward to all this as this is what I see
                  myself doing in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My goals for this course are to be able to properly understand
                  how the WWW works, and how I could make uploading my one
                  website VS the billions out there stand out from the rest. I
                  also look forward to learning the basics of code, as IT and
                  coding is the future. My goal is to understand the many
                  languages we will learn so I can apply them well in future. I
                  myself am not a very logical person, I am more artistic, and
                  the fact that this course embodies design, with front end
                  coding is exactly why I think this course is perfect for me
                  and I cannot wait to keep learning more.

                  This was a very exciting week, as I have finally begun
                  experimenting with the fundamentals of HTML. <br />
                  I was introduced to various different languages and histories
                  within this week, and in particularly we have started focusing
                  on HTML. Upon watching the lecture I’ve decided to practice
                  along and make my own notes. It was very interesting coming
                  across all the different functions HTML has to offer. They
                  looked simple, but immediately I had ideas going through my
                  head on how I could use these to create a bigger picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ive always struggled with high end coding and so far, as ive
                  been practicing HTML its very easy for me to do stuff
                  completely on my own by figuring it out and playing around
                  with it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I was a little bit confused at first when it came to Semantic
                  markup, as I didn’t really understand what I would use where,
                  but thankfully I stumbled upon Bruce Lawsons article on “Why
                  you should choose HTML5 article Over section”. It gave me a
                  better understanding of how these functions work and exactly
                  what they do. I didn’t know that just a simple function can
                  help the browser categorise your information for easy access
                  upon the WWW, it creates content. I’ve realized just how
                  important semantic markup is as when applied poorly, your
                  website can easily get lost within the billion others on the
                  Internet.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have also started looking into wireframes this week. I’ve
                  begun searching over the internet for inspiration on the
                  layout and structure of my website. So far, I have found a few
                  that peaked my interest and I have made wireframes for the
                  basis of my website based on what I’ve found. It appears all
                  software developers webs (what I was mainly looking into) have
                  a similar approach. I want to create something similar but
                  with my own artistic twist.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I am excited to get started and see what I can create using
                  these HTML fundamentals. I know I will have to research a lot
                  more as what was mentioned in the lecture is only but a
                  fragment.

                  I was worried at first to begin with CSS. I thought to myself
                  “I don’t even know HTML yet; how can I start learning a new
                  language already.”. I was confused as why we needed to use
                  multiple languages for a website, couldn’t HTML just do it
                  all? My questions were all answered upon watching this week’s
                  lecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While…TECHNICALLY HTML could create styling, it’s much more
                  efficient to make use of CSS instead.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <img src="Images/week3.png" class="websitetutPIC" /> I began
                  experimenting and working on some styling techniques and
                  honestly, its even more fun than HTML! I thought I properly
                  understood semantic markup from last week, but upon watching
                  my lecturer use them for styling techniques, I was left
                  confused on exactly why someone would use ID's vs Classes,
                  however, upon practicing the examples along with the video, i
                  quickly started understanding its uses and their differences.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have followed through the lecture and created the website
                  shown within. I felt so proud making something like this, even
                  though I basically just followed the video. It was still fun
                  none the less and I have learnt a lot from practicing this. I
                  will definelty use some of the techniques I have learnt from
                  this video for future practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ive learnt a lot about how interactivity is key and how i need
                  to create my website to respond in a certain fashion. I need
                  to create events within my webiste that will make it easier
                  for the user to navigate around. Not only that but i need to
                  use these styling techniques ive learnt to create a page that
                  flows nicely, and isnt an eyesore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thankfully, having studies art in highschool i have a very
                  good understanding of which colours work well together and
                  which dont. This will definetly aid me in creating a
                  successful webpage. From what ive seen so far, many webpages
                  use blue. I definetly think i will be using some form of blue
                  for mine as it is a gentle colour and works well with many
                  others. I also, unfortunately couldn’t get through the reading
                  for this week, but i will definetly catch it up on Monday.

                  This week we started with a new language, JavaScript. So far
                  this was the least enjoyable language as it reminds me a lot
                  of last year and using C# in game design. This is the more
                  logical side of coding and unfortunately, I am not strong in
                  this aspect, purely because I don’t understand JavaScript that
                  well. The exercises we had to do for this week were a pain and
                  I didn’t even complete majority of them as I didn’t know how
                  to approach it. Not only because of that but because I was a
                  little behind with work and only started working on this later
                  in the week.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Besides the complications with Java, I did however officially
                  start with my website this week. I made a basic home screen
                  using the knowledge I have learnt from the past weeks. I have
                  also payed special attention to this week and last weeks
                  readings regarding Interaction as I didn’t want to create a
                  hard to navigate website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I’ve learnt a lot this week about UI/UX and how to use them to
                  create a successful website. I looked through a lot of the
                  factors mentioned within these readings such as the systems,
                  interactions, symbolic representations etc, and have laid out
                  myself a few goals thanks to this. I was able to come up with
                  a couple questions and approaches such as “who is this
                  targeted towards to?” “What am I trying to achieve?” and I
                  have based my work so far off of that. A lot of my questions
                  were created through reading “The Basic Principles of User
                  Design” as it brought to my attention some questions, I need
                  to be asking myself, as well as approaches I should look at
                  when creating a website, how I can best use UI/UZX to achieve
                  this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thanks to all these readings and due to researching other
                  websites, I’ve decided to go with a simplistic approach, not
                  only because “Predictable design means it’s easy to understand
                  how to use functions without instruction.” (UXPin, 2020) but
                  because every website I’ve seen thus far consists of a
                  simplistic design as well as being straight forward towards
                  the user on what it has to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I aim to create an experience that is just like this, a basic
                  portfolio showcasing my skills and what i have to offer, and
                  that is what ive begun working on.

                  I am currently headed in a good position with my website. I
                  have received a lot of feedback from my peers based off of my
                  initial design and a lot of them suggested ways for
                  improvement. A lot of my structuring felt very cluttered, an
                  “information overload” and so I have decided to change the
                  layout of it all over again.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had to create new wireframes for the new ideas I had.
                  Luckily, I didn’t have to scrap much as the biggest change was
                  to my blog section and homepage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have used my final wireframes based off the feedback and
                  have made an almost fully functioning website. The websites
                  functionality felt clean and straight to the point, just like
                  how I wanted it to be and overall, I am very happy with my
                  progress. I have a few more functions and pages to implement
                  and then its safe to say that I have created my first proper
                  website!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I definitely feel that I have hit all the goals I was aiming
                  for so far. It was thanks to the readings and research I have
                  done that helped me create good UI/UX functions. I still,
                  however, have a lot to work and improve on, Especially when it
                  comes to semantic markup. Ive noticed that whist grouping
                  things, i often create too many containers for items, and
                  because of this my CSS styling page is becoming very long and
                  often confusing. I also get confused when referencing back to
                  my HTML code because of this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have a much bigger picture for my website and further
                  designs I want to implement but I am unsure if I will have
                  enough time to do so as redoing some of my pages cost me
                  time.<br /><br />
                  I will definitely aim to achieve these goals to the best of my
                  ability, nonetheless.

                  This week was a very interesting one. I’ve always known that
                  the internet itself is an infinite void of information, but it
                  was very interesting to learn just how many different types of
                  information can lie within, and how that effects our every day
                  lives. By going through the lectures and readings, ive
                  stumbled across three internet geographies. Access and
                  enablement, participation and representation which have been
                  defined according to Graham et all, 2015, Towards a study of
                  information geographies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a nutshell, this describes to us “who can, what they can do
                  and who they are. This is the epitome of the www and explains
                  to us just how many people can participate in many different
                  activities, contribute and represent themselves. This ties in
                  perfectly as this week we went deeper into the use of semantic
                  markup, microdata and data attributes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within our websites, we are the ones that seek to create a
                  piece of work that represents us and what we can do. The
                  “access and enablement, participation and representation” By
                  learning these data functions it becomes a lot easier for us
                  to achieve this and have our work more easily accessible as
                  through the use of semantic markup, google will be able to
                  better read and represent our work. When people search for
                  similar topics, semantic markup helps push out our topics to
                  those who search for it. The use of the metadata tags also
                  help display to others information about us and our website.
                  Its quite amazing just how everything is linked to one
                  another.

            <div class="accordion-item-header">Week 9 : Digital Inequalities / CSS</div>
            <div class="accordion-item-body">
              <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
                <p>
                  This week I’ve learnt about digital inequalities as well as
                  expanded my knowledge in CSS. Now I always knew about the
                  negatives online. Almost everyone who has access to the
                  internet has experienced some form of negative experience, or
                  in other words…. Digital inequality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Upon further research I have stumbled across a website that
                  categorizes digital inequalities into three different types.
                  The universal access divide, The Social divide and the gender
                  divide. (Flynn, 2021) It is known within the universal access
                  divide that not everyone is suited for the internet. There are
                  people out there who simply do not understand how it functions
                  or who are restricted from accessing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Such examples can be seen with people with disabilities, who
                  could struggle to navigate online. People in poorer countries
                  who do not have the money to even access these devices. Theres
                  people with low literacy or disorders will struggle to
                  navigate online, read and understand what is being presented,
                  having to resort to asking for help in person which can be
                  tedious and costly. There are so many inconsistencies when it
                  comes to the limitations of the digital world. In this day and
                  age, it is rapidly advancing and countries are pushing their
                  people to upgrade to the latest equipment and go “online” so
                  that they can keep up to date. This puts a toll on many people
                  as they are encouraged to “go with the flow” but simply lack
                  the resources or skills to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Social inequality then comes into play here as the people who
                  have access to these resources vs the people who don’t. When
                  it comes to socializing, it becomes very difficult for someone
                  who has access to the internet to speak to someone who
                  doesn’t. Since the internet stores every piece of information
                  you can imagine, for those who cannot see it, it becomes
                  difficult to socialize with and could potentially create
                  rifts. Majority of the younger generations these days only
                  socialize online as they do not lack the skills to socialize
                  in person! And when they do meet someone in person, unless
                  they are also involved with the internet and its many wonders,
                  they will struggle to make conversation with.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Last of the three mentioned within this article is the gender
                  divide. There are always stereotypes of how woman should be
                  the housekeepers whilst the men should be the ones who go out
                  to work and earn. This can affect a lot of women in the sense
                  that the digital world is stereotyped to be more fitting for
                  men. Men are the ones who should be experiencing these new
                  wonders and finding work on there whilst the woman should
                  stick and do what they always do. These stereotypes also end
                  up carrying themselves into gaming environments and social
                  media, where many sexist people will use these stereotypes
                  against woman, or even against men in the sense that “men are
                  slobs who sit around and game all day on their pc”
                </p>
                <p>
                  This opens up for a lot of negative influences and impacts
                  when it comes to gender. But as always, these are just a few
                  of the many things that come along with these topics, the list
                  of inequalities ae endless. All of these “digital inequalities
                  tend to mirror existing social inequalities in terms of
                  socio-economic status, education, gender, age, geographic
                  location, employment status, and race” (Lutz, 2019) as
                  mentioned above. Our best bet would be to try and prevent them
                  through certain practices, but even so, the internet will
                  always have a bunch that cannot stray away from the
                  negativity. We just need to ignore it and look for the
                  positive ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Alongside all of the information I have learnt about digital
                  inequalities this week, I have also further expanded my CSS
                  knowledge with the use of flexboxes and grids. Whilst working
                  on my website for the first assignment, there were SO many
                  unique ways I wanted to structure my website and decorate it,
                  I remember searching for ways to create these structures on
                  YouTube and majority of them mentioned flexbox. Since it was
                  something, I’ve never heard about I decided to go mor basic
                  since I feared it would be difficult to approach, and also
                  since we have not learnt it. This week showed me that not only
                  is flexbox super useful and easy, but in future whilst
                  researching, I should take any opportunity to watch the videos
                  and try understand what is happening as you never know if you
                  will need or come across that in the future. That is the key
                  to becoming a successful dev!

                I’ve learnt a lot this week when it comes to how influential AI really is in this day and age. 
                Firstly, I’ve looked at Verdi’s The road to techno colonialism and examined just how much ai has shaped our world 
                and its economic decisions. Before, power came from resources and military power. Whilst this is still the case ai
                 is slowly taking over that. It has given many other countries significant more power especially those that were
                  already prominent with technology.</p>
                  <p>
                  “AI has the potential to drive global productivity upwards by automating
                   routine tasks, enhancing jobs that survive and disrupting entire industries.” (Verdi, 2020) Countries can 
                   use AI for more economical and military gain that was never possible before. Overthrowing some countries
                    or being overthrown... all depending on the technological resources that country has. Not only this but 
                    AI itself is colonialising us! We are in the technological era and by scanning through multiple readings, 
                    AI has already begun to take over many of our jobs and responsibilities as humans. While its beneficial 
                    from the point because then it will be more consistent and efficient, its negative as we are slowly being 
                    replaced by technology itself. </p>
                    <p>                   
                      
                      Even though some may find a negative in this, the technological impact isn’t all that bad. It also opens room to “colonise” in
                     different ways, such as to spread digital information throughout the world that not everyone knows about. This can be especially 
                      powerful when looking at cultures. “Representations
                      of current ideas may vary, and people with different
                    cultural backgrounds may have novel ideas that differ from those of the north-western cultures” (Tedre 2006, 128) Society has become
                     very westernized, so with technology that opens up room for many cultures and ideologies to be recognized and represented. This will
                    not only help us “rethink
                    how to teach the use and development of technological tools in culturally relevant ways.” (Tedre 2006, 129) But this opens up a huge 
                    learning ground for our society and only helps us acknowledge and truly appreciate our diversity. </p>
                    <p> 
                    It just goes to show just how much technology has an impact in this day and age. It’s truly amazing that I am studying 
                    something that falls under that, where I could potentially be seen working with technology to create and be apart of
                    something truly marvellous in the future. Week by week I learn more and more just how important this course is.
                     AI and IT is the future, it has already begun influencing our world so much. In the very future the digital colonialism 
                      could very well overthrow many jobs that ai can do better than humans, but those technologies will always need a couple 
                    programmers and designers working behind them. </p>

               This week wasnt that productive for me. I was pretty sick so i have only briefly scanned through the works.
               I started off this week by practicing a few JavaScript exercises. For a while now JavaScript has been very challenging for me. 
               I have just gotten properly use to working with HTML and CSS and every since JavaScript came into the pictrue it threw me off a bit.
               It was similar to the coding we did last year within Game Design and i was starting to worry that i wouldnt be able to understand what
               i am doing just like last year. These weekly exercises have been challenging me but in a good way, they are helping me learn and also
               helping improve my researching skills as i am constantly searching what i do not understand. </p>
               <p>
                Besides that i have also slowly started to work on my website. I have been researching new and effective ways to structure some of my pages
                as well as methods i could apply to my website to better improve it. I remember when i handed in my first website i thought it was amazing, 
                but as i worked more and more on it i found so many things wrong with not only the code but the actual website as well. 
                I am just excited to improve all of this and improve my skills as well.</p>

This week we were diving deeper into digital inclusion and exclusion. 
During week 9 I’ve researched and spoken about just how many digital inequalities there are, and we’ve further expanded that
 topic this week. It once again brough to our attention how technology can either include or dismiss something. 
With the technological era ever expanding, it leaves room for so many people in poverty to fall even further behind. They are 
excluded from the digital and technological benefits especially since majority of the world is switching to “online”</p>
<p>
Similarly, I’ve spoken last week how technology helps promote cultures and representations. Whilst this is true its often very 
difficult for isolated cultures to be recognized as they do not have the means to access technology and represent themselves. 
Then there Is the issue that even if we all come online to represent ourselves and who we truly are, the socio-economic status
 creates challenges for people access the digital world. Online there are many stereotypes and non-inclusive people.</p>
 <p>Representation is a major part of society these days, and everyone should feel included. With this knowledge we should strive to create websites and online environments where everybody could be included regardless of the stereotypes and negative socio-economic constructs. 
Looking at a website like https://www.internetjustsociety.org/
It’s a perfect example of what to include onto your website to cater and include everyone. As the internets negativity is ever 
growing, we need to bunch together to create more positivity within, and it can even start with a small website.</p> 

<p>
This has really opened my eyes when it comes to my process and journey. I have always known that websites should be user friendly
 and easy to access but I completely forgot about the representation aspect of it. This will definitely help shift my creation of 
 my website in a positive direction.</p>
 <p>
Besides this, I have also officially physically begun working on my website. I have just been taking it pretty slow, mainly watching 
videos and gathering information so that I can compile my website all at once without hesitation. 
I had many problems with structuring my code and semantically referencing it when it came to the first assignment, so I just spent this
 week properly going through everything and slowly changing the bits and pieces of my code.</p>

              Its crazy to think just how far i have come in this journey. I have spent countless weeks practicing code, researching as well as 
              updating my website and experinemting with its functionality. Last year, we were introduced to coding so suddenly that it took 
              us a while to grasp things. Everytime we had a assignment due majority of us would rely on youtube as we barely understood
              what to do and how to do it. I was worried that for this website and course it would be the same, but i am proud to say that i can code my 
              website not only on my own but solve my own problems and queries. Of course, no dev can just do everythin on their own. Youtube played 
              a big role in helping me create my website and update it.

              I have learnt so much in this space of time and i am still learning. I have found and corrected many errors within my website 
              and ever still correcting!
              Whilst i have become very familiar with HTML and CSS i am still working and improving on better understanding JS as that heads into the 
              more complex and problem solving of code. So far i have managed just fine with it but i can only imagine what difficulties and challenges lie in the future!
              I cannot wait to improve my stills and solve them.
