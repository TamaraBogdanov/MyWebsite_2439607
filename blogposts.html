                I have learnt a lot this week, and we barely even started!
                <br />
                In this course we will be not only learning about how the WWW
                works, but we will be contributing to it. We will be creating
                out own " personal hypertext system used for keeping track of
                personal information on a distributed project” (Berners, 792)
                AKA creating our own website! <br /><br />
                I started off by choosing a reading, in more particular, “Tim
                Berners-Lee et al. – 1994 – The World Wide Web”<br />
                I have chosen this one as everything has the WWW at its route,
                and I wanted to learn more about how its all connected. The
                first step was starting with GitHub. Fortunately, I have worked
                with GitHub last year so I did not have to install it for
                understand how it works as I already did that. Then it clicked
                to me, after reading the reading just how GitHub perfectly
                embodies the WWW. “The World-Wide Web (W3) was developed to be a
                pool of human knowledge, which would allow collaborators in
                remote sites to share their ideas and all aspects of a common
                project” (Berners, 792) The second I read this line, GitHub
                immediately came to mind, and how we will be uploading our
                thoughts and ideas as a common project onto there, eventually
                forming our website which will be for everybody to see, and the
                base of it all starts with HTML, the “common basic language of
                interchange for hypertext”. (Berners, 795) <br /><br />
                Majority of the content within the web consists of HTML so I was
                very excited to dive deeper and learn it. Upon watching the
                lecture, I noticed that so far, HTML appeared very easy. It
                mainly consisted of being the base structure of the website,
                that includes the menus, lists, contact lists etc, but I
                realised that HTML was the basics of a much larger picture, it
                was just the shell of the complicated WWW I am really looking
                forward to all this as this is what I see myself doing in the
                future. My goals for this course are to be able to properly
                understand how the WWW works, and how I could make uploading my
                one website VS the billions out there stand out from the rest. I
                also look forward to learning the basics of code, as IT and
                coding is the future. My goal is to understand the many
                languages we will learn so I can apply them well in future. I
                myself am not a very logical person, I am more artistic, and the
                fact that this course embodies design, with front end coding is
                exactly why I think this course is perfect for me and I cannot
                wait to keep learning more.

                This was a very exciting week, as I have finally begun
                experimenting with the fundamentals of HTML. <br />
                I was introduced to various different languages and histories
                within this week, and in particularly we have started focusing
                on HTML. Upon watching the lecture I’ve decided to practice
                along and make my own notes. It was very interesting coming
                across all the different functions HTML has to offer. They
                looked simple, but immediately I had ideas going through my head
                on how I could use these to create a bigger picture.
                <br /><br />

                Ive always struggled with high end coding and so far, as ive
                been practicing HTML its very easy for me to do stuff completely
                on my own by figuring it out and playing around with it.<br /><br />

                I was a little bit confused at first when it came to Semantic
                markup, as I didn’t really understand what I would use where,
                but thankfully I stumbled upon Bruce Lawsons article on “Why you
                should choose HTML5 article Over section”. It gave me a better
                understanding of how these functions work and exactly what they
                do. I didn’t know that just a simple function can help the
                browser categorise your information for easy access upon the
                WWW, it creates content. I’ve realized just how important
                semantic markup is as when applied poorly, your website can
                easily get lost within the billion others on the Internet.
                <br /><br />

                I have also started looking into wireframes this week. I’ve
                begun searching over the internet for inspiration on the layout
                and structure of my website. So far, I have found a few that
                peaked my interest and I have made wireframes for the basis of
                my website based on what I’ve found. It appears all software
                developers webs (what I was mainly looking into) have a similar
                approach. I want to create something similar but with my own
                artistic twist. <br /><br />

                I am excited to get started and see what I can create using
                these HTML fundamentals. I know I will have to research a lot
                more as what was mentioned in the lecture is only but a
                fragment.

                I was worried at first to begin with CSS. I thought to myself “I
                don’t even know HTML yet; how can I start learning a new
                language already.”. I was confused as why we needed to use
                multiple languages for a website, couldn’t HTML just do it all?
                My questions were all answered upon watching this week’s
                lecture. <br /><br />
                While…TECHNICALLY HTML could create styling, it’s much more
                efficient to make use of CSS instead.

                <img src="Images/week3.png" class="websitetutPIC" />
                I began experimenting and working on some styling techniques and
                honestly, its even more fun than HTML! I thought I properly
                understood semantic markup from last week, but upon watching my
                lecturer use them for styling techniques, I was left confused on
                exactly why someone would use ID's vs Classes, however, upon
                practicing the examples along with the video, i quickly started
                understanding its uses and their differences. <br /><br />

                I have followed through the lecture and created the website
                shown within. I felt so proud making something like this, even
                though I basically just followed the video. It was still fun
                none the less and I have learnt a lot from practicing this. I
                will definelty use some of the techniques I have learnt from
                this video for future practices.
                <br /><br />
                <br />

                Ive learnt a lot about how interactivity is key and how i need
                to create my website to respond in a certain fashion. I need to
                create events within my webiste that will make it easier for the
                user to navigate around. Not only that but i need to use these
                styling techniques ive learnt to create a page that flows
                nicely, and isnt an eyesore. <br /><br />
                Thankfully, having studies art in highschool i have a very good
                understanding of which colours work well together and which
                dont. This will definetly aid me in creating a successful
                webpage. From what ive seen so far, many webpages use blue. I
                definetly think i will be using some form of blue for mine as it
                is a gentle colour and works well with many others.

                <br /><br />
                I also, unfortunately couldn’t get through the reading for this
                week, but i will definetly catch it up on Monday.

                This week we started with a new language, JavaScript. So far
                this was the least enjoyable language as it reminds me a lot of
                last year and using C# in game design. This is the more logical
                side of coding and unfortunately, I am not strong in this
                aspect, purely because I don’t understand JavaScript that well.
                The exercises we had to do for this week were a pain and I
                didn’t even complete majority of them as I didn’t know how to
                approach it. Not only because of that but because I was a little
                behind with work and only started working on this later in the
                week.<br /><br />

                Besides the complications with Java, I did however officially
                start with my website this week. I made a basic home screen
                using the knowledge I have learnt from the past weeks. I have
                also payed special attention to this week and last weeks
                readings regarding Interaction as I didn’t want to create a hard
                to navigate website.<br /><br />
                I’ve learnt a lot this week about UI/UX and how to use them to
                create a successful website. I looked through a lot of the
                factors mentioned within these readings such as the systems,
                interactions, symbolic representations etc, and have laid out
                myself a few goals thanks to this. I was able to come up with a
                couple questions and approaches such as “who is this targeted
                towards to?” “What am I trying to achieve?” and I have based my
                work so far off of that. A lot of my questions were created
                through reading “The Basic Principles of User Design” as it
                brought to my attention some questions, I need to be asking
                myself, as well as approaches I should look at when creating a
                website, how I can best use UI/UZX to achieve this.<br /><br />

                Thanks to all these readings and due to researching other
                websites, I’ve decided to go with a simplistic approach, not
                only because “Predictable design means it’s easy to understand
                how to use functions without instruction.” (UXPin, 2020) but
                because every website I’ve seen thus far consists of a
                simplistic design as well as being straight forward towards the
                user on what it has to offer. <br /><br />
                I aim to create an experience that is just like this, a basic
                portfolio showcasing my skills and what i have to offer, and
                that is what ive begun working on.

                I am currently headed in a good position with my website. I have
                received a lot of feedback from my peers based off of my initial
                design and a lot of them suggested ways for improvement. A lot
                of my structuring felt very cluttered, an “information overload”
                and so I have decided to change the layout of it all over
                again.<br /><br />
                I had to create new wireframes for the new ideas I had. Luckily,
                I didn’t have to scrap much as the biggest change was to my blog
                section and homepage. <br /><br />

                I have used my final wireframes based off the feedback and have
                made an almost fully functioning website. The websites
                functionality felt clean and straight to the point, just like
                how I wanted it to be and overall, I am very happy with my
                progress. I have a few more functions and pages to implement and
                then its safe to say that I have created my first proper
                website!<br /><br />

                I definitely feel that I have hit all the goals I was aiming for
                so far. It was thanks to the readings and research I have done
                that helped me create good UI/UX functions. I still, however,
                have a lot to work and improve on, Especially when it comes to
                semantic markup. Ive noticed that whist grouping things, i often
                create too many containers for items, and because of this my CSS
                styling page is becoming very long and often confusing. I also
                get confused when referencing back to my HTML code because of
                this. <br /><br />
                I have a much bigger picture for my website and further designs
                I want to implement but I am unsure if I will have enough time
                to do so as redoing some of my pages cost me time.<br /><br />
                I will definitely aim to achieve these goals to the best of my
                ability, nonetheless.
