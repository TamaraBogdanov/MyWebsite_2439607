        <h1 class="EssayBody">UI / UX Essay</h1>
        <section class="essayBG">
        <p>
          I have decided to analyse Sun City Resorts website,
          SunInternational.com. Let’s start by looking at what lies within. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, all websites should contain three elements, being UI, UX and
          IA. All of these elements work together as a semiotic system, The UI
          is all neatly organized according to the IA so that it can be legible
          and understandable for the UX. Upon first glance, SunInternational.com
          includes a basic homepage, consisting of images and sectioned
          information with a detailed navbar and logo above. </p>
          <p>
        Higher up within
          the navbar consists of a sign-in and booking option if one wishes to
          make an account to book. There is also a section that takes you to
          download their own app. Lower down the Navbar are the navigation
          options, featuring links that describe their services and offers. Atop
          the homepage they display their most important features such as the
          booking and navbar. Slightly below lie the loyalty programs, contact
          information as well as a bunch of sections containing small
          descriptions of their main services, being the casino, valley of the
          waves and nature experiences, all of which contain a link that take
          you to a more detailed description (also located in Navbar). It is
          easy to read and navigate and all of the link’s work together to
          create an Interactive system.</p>
          <p>

           Diving deeper, the basis of every
          website always starts with the UI, the graphics and visual aspect that
          evoke the actual interaction. Looking at SunInternational.com, it has
          a green and white themed page. According to, UXPin’s “Web UI Design
          for the Human Eye — Part 4” green promotes environmental themes and
          relaxation whereas white promotes cleanliness, simplicity and acts to
          make the other colours on the page stand out. (Cao J, Zięba K,
          Stryjewski K, Ellis M, 2020) As Sun City itself is associated with
          nature, they purposely combined these two colours so the white would
          make the green stand out, symbolizing what they include and where they
          are based in, nature. This is where UX comes along, with green being a
          cool colour it creates a tranquil feeling that soothes our minds and
          is easy on the eyes. A website should use “colour contrast to ensure
          clear readability.” (UserWay, 2023) and we can see
          SunInternational.com doing just that.</p>
          
          <p>

         They use very contrasting
          colours such as the green, white, red, blues and purples etc, majority
          being cool colours. Occasionally warmer colours such as red and yellow
          are used when they want to bring something to the user’s attention,
          such as warnings and benefits. They also use white text on darker
          colours to allow for easy readability, and then black on the white
          backgrounds which “provides the highest level of contrast and
          readability” (UserWay, 2023) With the occasional darker greens for
          specific headings. Darker greens and shades are mainly present within
          the navbar, and since the text is white here to create contrast, when
          the user hovers over the links it highlights blue. Since the common
          theme is tranquil cool colours, it was wise of them to use a soft blue
          here as it doesn’t stand out too much, but it still shows the user
          which section they are clicking on.  </p>
          
          <p>
          Throughout the whole website we
          notice that they mainly use input controls such as buttons. Wherever
          there are coloured backgrounds, as mentioned white text is predominate
          here, which means if there are button present, their text and outline
          is white too. To combat this, when the user hovers over them, they
          have smartly highlighted the whole button to white, changing the text
          within to black and promoting the prefect contrast in this situation.
          I did, however, notice that lower down the page, by the” Sun MGV
          Loyalty Programme” the buttons are already coloured white, so when you
          hover over them the text just disappears. Maybe it followed the same
          effect as all the other buttons and they forgot that this one was
          originally coloured white instead of outlined, or maybe because this
          is now a separate section, they decided to completely change those two
          buttons and their effects, which in my opinion doesn’t make sense and
          strays from the consistency they created throughout. Going back to the
          input controls, they also use drop down lists and date fields which
          can be seen at the beginning, so the user can book and select which
          date/hotel they wish to occupy and whether it is available or not.
          There are also navigational components such as the website slider and
          search icon located in the navbar. Informational components are also
          present. When you first load the website there are two that appear,
          being cookies and location. Icons are also present to make it easier
          for the user to navigate, such as the magnifying for the search bar,
          portrait icon for signing in/up. Their logo is also an interactable
          icon which takes you to the home page. </p>
          
          <p>
          Further down into the website’s
          homepage, there are also 4 icons displayed next to information about
          the time, location, temperature and coordinates of the place. The
          icons, making it easier for us as the users to identify what these
          bits of information are without having to pay much attention. Now as
          you can see from the previous paragraphs, there is clearly a lot of
          information within the website. However, looking at the IA, they
          include a lot of imagery and white space, which gives the user a break
          from all this. They nicely separate information within sections and
          these images/spaces either break these sections up or embody them.
          Such an example can be seen how lower down into the website’s
          homepage, the background transitions from white to an image of The
          Valley of The Waves. The only information present here is located in a
          small box on the right, which is about the valley of the waves itself.
          The image creates a section for that information but also gives the
          user a break from all the text, where we can admire some imagery and
          give our eyes a rest. The text itself is neatly organized within boxes
          or sections. There is always either an image or white space adding
          breaks between text boxes to minimize clutter. “It’s Important that
          your homepage has a clear message and represents your services and
          products in an interesting manner.” (Sebjanic, 2018)
        </p>
        <p>
         Their homepage
          upon first glance, consists mainly of an image of the resort itself, a
          navbar taking users to all the sections it offers and then a section
          for where you can place your booking. Lower down there are sections
          giving small descriptions of their services which can be linked to the
          same navbar links. Their homepage is a clear message on what it
          offers, what the website is about, and it is easy to navigate to
          sections you are interested in. Diving into the Ethics of websites,
          SunInternational.com displays quite a few. For a start the website
          throughout remains consistent and simple. Repeated themes and colours
          and used to promote simplicity and consistency, allowing the user to
          easily navigate throughout.</p>
          <p>
          Eye strain is a big red flag among
          websites. Looking back at UserWays “Digital Eye Strain is Common Among
          all Users” There are 8 points on how a website can reduce eye strain
          relief and SunInternational.com has checked 7 of those 8 points.
          1.They use larger fonts, mainly as headings for sections but as well
          as to highlight certain activities and programs. I have noticed that
          their paragraph text is quite small and this can be seen as a negative
          factor towards some. 2.They use proper line height. The sentences
          don’t feel cluttered, and everything remains consistent throughout.
          3.They apply strong colour contrasts to the text and backgrounds not
          to strain the eye. 4.They have multiple sub headlines, breaking up the
          general pattern and bringing forth critical points as these days,
          majority of people skim through text. 6.They integrated lots of images
          to also break up sections and add a visual idea to the viewer of how
          parts of the resort look. 7. They also have short sentences that never
          exceed more than 5 lines in paragraphs. Everything is kept short,
          sweet and simple. Server wise, everything takes rather quickly to
          load, making it use less energy and therefore ethnically efficient.
          Whilst clicking on hyperlinks, it takes a second to load but then all
          the images and information is immediately loaded at once on the page,
          so users don’t have to wait to see certain sections and potentially
          lose interest. They also give you notifications for cookies and to
          access location, both of which the user can ignore or accept. This
          doesn’t invade privacy and offers the users a choice. The website is
          also accessible on multiple platforms so that users can access it from
          any device they are using. </p>
          
          <p>
          Further adding on to this, we will look at
          Renee Fleck’s “5 golden rules of ethical web design (& how to apply
          them)” We can see how SunInternational.com has used these 5 rules
          within their website. The five rules and their use being: 1. Focus on
          the Message. the website conveyed their message clearly on what their
          site offers. Their most important feature lies in the homepage and
          navbar, everything else is extra information that influences the user
          to attend their resort as well as offers and abouts. There are no
          intrusive pop ups but the two notifications for cookies and location
          in the beginning. Everything is kept relevant and of importance. 2.
          Keep Your layout neat. The websites layout is neat and simple, their
          headings are easy to read throughout majority of the website, however
          I’ve noticed that majority of the paragraphs consist of small sized
          text, which might be difficult for users with poor eyesight to read.
          3. Choose user-friendly fonts. The website uses clear and legible
          fonts throughout. 4. Avoid animation hell. There is no animation or
          videos present in order to keep the website running smoothly. There is
          already so much information present that animations and videos would
          make the website have too much going on. 5. Make it easy to navigate.
          Their website is easy to navigate throughout. Everything is grouped
          into sections and the links take you to different pages explaining
          their services.</p>

          <p>
           Although the website itself seemed to follow majority
          of the ethics I have researched upon, one thing that stood out for me
          negatively was firstly, their use of small text within the paragraphs
          but more importantly, was their lack of translation. Since Sun City is
          a popular resort that attracts tourist from all over the world, I
          decided to test whether the website would offer an option to translate
          if a foreigner opened it. I sent the link to my friend living in
          Germany and using a certain browser, the browsers itself would
          translate the page. Since not everyone will use the same browser I
          asked him to open it using a different one, and there was no option
          for translation. For a foreigner with little understanding of English
          this would be a huge negative factor. It also did also not ask him for
          his location (as he was using the mobile version) whereas it has asked
          me on my pc. I believe if maybe the website asked for his location, it
          could have been a different story, but this was one flaw I have
          noticed within the mobile version of the website. Overall, I believe
          their site embodies what a good website should be. “For your website
          to be successful it needs work, and it starts with web design and
          continues all the way through SEO, online marketing, web security and
          implementation of trust signals. All of these elements need to work
          together.” (Sebjanic, 2018)</p>

          <p>
           Throughout the research I have done, many
          of the ethical and practical pointers for websites have been followed
          by SunInternational.com. Even though I’ve encountered a few
          discrepancies, their website still remained consistent, simple and
          easy to navigate. The web design flowed well and was user friendly, it
          was compatible on other devices and implemented trust signals.
