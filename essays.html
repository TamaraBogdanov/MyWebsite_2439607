              <h2>UI/UX Analysis Essay</h2>
              <p>
                I have decided to analyse Sun City Resorts website,
                SunInternational.com. Let’s start by looking at what lies within. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Firstly, all websites should contain three elements, being UI, UX and
                IA. All of these elements work together as a semiotic system, The UI
                is all neatly organized according to the IA so that it can be legible
                and understandable for the UX. Upon first glance, SunInternational.com
                includes a basic homepage, consisting of images and sectioned
                information with a detailed navbar and logo above. </p>
                <p>
              Higher up within
                the navbar consists of a sign-in and booking option if one wishes to
                make an account to book. There is also a section that takes you to
                download their own app. Lower down the Navbar are the navigation
                options, featuring links that describe their services and offers. Atop
                the homepage they display their most important features such as the
                booking and navbar. Slightly below lie the loyalty programs, contact
                information as well as a bunch of sections containing small
                descriptions of their main services, being the casino, valley of the
                waves and nature experiences, all of which contain a link that take
                you to a more detailed description (also located in Navbar). It is
                easy to read and navigate and all of the link’s work together to
                create an Interactive system.</p>
                <p>
      
                 Diving deeper, the basis of every
                website always starts with the UI, the graphics and visual aspect that
                evoke the actual interaction. Looking at SunInternational.com, it has
                a green and white themed page. According to, UXPin’s “Web UI Design
                for the Human Eye — Part 4” green promotes environmental themes and
                relaxation whereas white promotes cleanliness, simplicity and acts to
                make the other colours on the page stand out. (Cao J, Zięba K,
                Stryjewski K, Ellis M, 2020) As Sun City itself is associated with
                nature, they purposely combined these two colours so the white would
                make the green stand out, symbolizing what they include and where they
                are based in, nature. This is where UX comes along, with green being a
                cool colour it creates a tranquil feeling that soothes our minds and
                is easy on the eyes. A website should use “colour contrast to ensure
                clear readability.” (UserWay, 2023) and we can see
                SunInternational.com doing just that.</p>
                
                <p>
      
               They use very contrasting
                colours such as the green, white, red, blues and purples etc, majority
                being cool colours. Occasionally warmer colours such as red and yellow
                are used when they want to bring something to the user’s attention,
                such as warnings and benefits. They also use white text on darker
                colours to allow for easy readability, and then black on the white
                backgrounds which “provides the highest level of contrast and
                readability” (UserWay, 2023) With the occasional darker greens for
                specific headings. Darker greens and shades are mainly present within
                the navbar, and since the text is white here to create contrast, when
                the user hovers over the links it highlights blue. Since the common
                theme is tranquil cool colours, it was wise of them to use a soft blue
                here as it doesn’t stand out too much, but it still shows the user
                which section they are clicking on.  </p>
                
                <p>
                Throughout the whole website we
                notice that they mainly use input controls such as buttons. Wherever
                there are coloured backgrounds, as mentioned white text is predominate
                here, which means if there are button present, their text and outline
                is white too. To combat this, when the user hovers over them, they
                have smartly highlighted the whole button to white, changing the text
                within to black and promoting the prefect contrast in this situation.
                I did, however, notice that lower down the page, by the” Sun MGV
                Loyalty Programme” the buttons are already coloured white, so when you
                hover over them the text just disappears. Maybe it followed the same
                effect as all the other buttons and they forgot that this one was
                originally coloured white instead of outlined, or maybe because this
                is now a separate section, they decided to completely change those two
                buttons and their effects, which in my opinion doesn’t make sense and
                strays from the consistency they created throughout. Going back to the
                input controls, they also use drop down lists and date fields which
                can be seen at the beginning, so the user can book and select which
                date/hotel they wish to occupy and whether it is available or not.
                There are also navigational components such as the website slider and
                search icon located in the navbar. Informational components are also
                present. When you first load the website there are two that appear,
                being cookies and location. Icons are also present to make it easier
                for the user to navigate, such as the magnifying for the search bar,
                portrait icon for signing in/up. Their logo is also an interactable
                icon which takes you to the home page. </p>
                
                <p>
                Further down into the website’s
                homepage, there are also 4 icons displayed next to information about
                the time, location, temperature and coordinates of the place. The
                icons, making it easier for us as the users to identify what these
                bits of information are without having to pay much attention. Now as
                you can see from the previous paragraphs, there is clearly a lot of
                information within the website. However, looking at the IA, they
                include a lot of imagery and white space, which gives the user a break
                from all this. They nicely separate information within sections and
                these images/spaces either break these sections up or embody them.
                Such an example can be seen how lower down into the website’s
                homepage, the background transitions from white to an image of The
                Valley of The Waves. The only information present here is located in a
                small box on the right, which is about the valley of the waves itself.
                The image creates a section for that information but also gives the
                user a break from all the text, where we can admire some imagery and
                give our eyes a rest. The text itself is neatly organized within boxes
                or sections. There is always either an image or white space adding
                breaks between text boxes to minimize clutter. “It’s Important that
                your homepage has a clear message and represents your services and
                products in an interesting manner.” (Sebjanic, 2018)
              </p>
              <p>
               Their homepage
                upon first glance, consists mainly of an image of the resort itself, a
                navbar taking users to all the sections it offers and then a section
                for where you can place your booking. Lower down there are sections
                giving small descriptions of their services which can be linked to the
                same navbar links. Their homepage is a clear message on what it
                offers, what the website is about, and it is easy to navigate to
                sections you are interested in. Diving into the Ethics of websites,
                SunInternational.com displays quite a few. For a start the website
                throughout remains consistent and simple. Repeated themes and colours
                and used to promote simplicity and consistency, allowing the user to
                easily navigate throughout.</p>
                <p>
                Eye strain is a big red flag among
                websites. Looking back at UserWays “Digital Eye Strain is Common Among
                all Users” There are 8 points on how a website can reduce eye strain
                relief and SunInternational.com has checked 7 of those 8 points.
                1.They use larger fonts, mainly as headings for sections but as well
                as to highlight certain activities and programs. I have noticed that
                their paragraph text is quite small and this can be seen as a negative
                factor towards some. 2.They use proper line height. The sentences
                don’t feel cluttered, and everything remains consistent throughout.
                3.They apply strong colour contrasts to the text and backgrounds not
                to strain the eye. 4.They have multiple sub headlines, breaking up the
                general pattern and bringing forth critical points as these days,
                majority of people skim through text. 6.They integrated lots of images
                to also break up sections and add a visual idea to the viewer of how
                parts of the resort look. 7. They also have short sentences that never
                exceed more than 5 lines in paragraphs. Everything is kept short,
                sweet and simple. Server wise, everything takes rather quickly to
                load, making it use less energy and therefore ethnically efficient.
                Whilst clicking on hyperlinks, it takes a second to load but then all
                the images and information is immediately loaded at once on the page,
                so users don’t have to wait to see certain sections and potentially
                lose interest. They also give you notifications for cookies and to
                access location, both of which the user can ignore or accept. This
                doesn’t invade privacy and offers the users a choice. The website is
                also accessible on multiple platforms so that users can access it from
                any device they are using. </p>
                
                <p>
                Further adding on to this, we will look at
                Renee Fleck’s “5 golden rules of ethical web design (& how to apply
                them)” We can see how SunInternational.com has used these 5 rules
                within their website. The five rules and their use being: 1. Focus on
                the Message. the website conveyed their message clearly on what their
                site offers. Their most important feature lies in the homepage and
                navbar, everything else is extra information that influences the user
                to attend their resort as well as offers and abouts. There are no
                intrusive pop ups but the two notifications for cookies and location
                in the beginning. Everything is kept relevant and of importance. 2.
                Keep Your layout neat. The websites layout is neat and simple, their
                headings are easy to read throughout majority of the website, however
                I’ve noticed that majority of the paragraphs consist of small sized
                text, which might be difficult for users with poor eyesight to read.
                3. Choose user-friendly fonts. The website uses clear and legible
                fonts throughout. 4. Avoid animation hell. There is no animation or
                videos present in order to keep the website running smoothly. There is
                already so much information present that animations and videos would
                make the website have too much going on. 5. Make it easy to navigate.
                Their website is easy to navigate throughout. Everything is grouped
                into sections and the links take you to different pages explaining
                their services.</p>
      
                <p>
                 Although the website itself seemed to follow majority
                of the ethics I have researched upon, one thing that stood out for me
                negatively was firstly, their use of small text within the paragraphs
                but more importantly, was their lack of translation. Since Sun City is
                a popular resort that attracts tourist from all over the world, I
                decided to test whether the website would offer an option to translate
                if a foreigner opened it. I sent the link to my friend living in
                Germany and using a certain browser, the browsers itself would
                translate the page. Since not everyone will use the same browser I
                asked him to open it using a different one, and there was no option
                for translation. For a foreigner with little understanding of English
                this would be a huge negative factor. It also did also not ask him for
                his location (as he was using the mobile version) whereas it has asked
                me on my pc. I believe if maybe the website asked for his location, it
                could have been a different story, but this was one flaw I have
                noticed within the mobile version of the website. Overall, I believe
                their site embodies what a good website should be. “For your website
                to be successful it needs work, and it starts with web design and
                continues all the way through SEO, online marketing, web security and
                implementation of trust signals. All of these elements need to work
                together.” (Sebjanic, 2018)</p>
      
                <p>
                 Throughout the research I have done, many
                of the ethical and practical pointers for websites have been followed
                by SunInternational.com. Even though I’ve encountered a few
                discrepancies, their website still remained consistent, simple and
                easy to navigate. The web design flowed well and was user friendly, it
                was compatible on other devices and implemented trust signals.

              <h2>AI Risks Final Essay</h2>
              <p>
               
The Statement on AI Risk refers to a letter that was signed by leaders and researchers within the AI industry. 
The signatories of the statement “include people from leading technology companies such as Google, Meta AI, Microsoft, and OpenAI, as well as from leading educational institutions such as Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and the University of California Berkeley.” (Ahearn, 2013)

              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, the statement was created in order to bring awareness to the potential dangers of AI risk. It would be too tedious for all these leaders and researchers to voice their concerns individually, they have in return created a statement that everyone could sign, which is “meant to create common knowledge of the growing number of experts and public figures who also take some of advanced AI’s most severe risks seriously.” (Center for AI Safety, AI Risk) </p>
                <p>
                  For the CAIS to display and gather such well-known leaders to sign such a letter only shows to us how prominent AI risk really is. If these leaders of AI themselves find it such a risk, then us as the consumers of AI definitely need it brought to our attention.
                  With technology rapidly advancing, AI itself is becoming more and more prominent within our lives. 
                  </p>

                  According to the Center for AI Safety, there are certain factors in where AI can become dangerous, such as “to perpetuate bias, power autonomous weapons, promote misinformation, and conduct cyberattacks.” (Center for AI Safety, 8 Examples of AI Risk)</p>
                
                <p>
      
                  One of the many factors on AI risk is misinformation. This can be tied into the topic of Digital Inequalities and how that is displayed within the WWW.   </p>
                
                <p>
                  The WWW is such a huge and never-ending system of information. It “is an information system enabling information to be shared over the Internet through simplified ways” (Wikipedia, WWW)
                  This is a very powerful tool that gives anybody the power to have a say in the digital world, which will displayed for millions of people to see. This can be very helpful in certain factors, but very negative in others as in the hands of the wrong people, negative impressions can be spread throughout. 
                   </p>
                
                <p>
                  Already now, “digital inequalities tend to mirror existing social inequalities in terms of socio-economic status, education, gender, age, geographic location, employment status, and race” (Lutz, 2019) The WWW houses a variety of negative people that create and advocate for certain stereotypes and inequalities. Since online you can be anonymous, there are almost no repercussions for what you say on there are majority of the time, it cannot be directly traced back to you. In return this causes for a lot of people to disrespect people’s boundaries. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Looking into the Gender divide within Digital Inequalities, already online there hare stereotypes of how woman should be housekeepers, whilst the men should work. Since there are naturally, more males accessing the digital world, this creates a stereotype for how the digital world is more fitting for men, and how woman should not be on it. Not only this, but other stronger stereotypes on sexuality are becoming so much prominent. This is especially dangerous when we look at how AI processes information. Looking at ChatGPT as an example, “this high-capable chatbot uses machine learning algorithms to process and analyse large amounts of data to generate responses to user inquiries” (University of Central Arkansas)</p>
                <p>
                  If there are many sources out there with these stereotypical mindsets, AI itself can read this widespread information and in return, create negative misinformation. It is programmed to read sources online and process that information down as a summary for the user. If many sources online are stating that woman should not be included in the digital world, AI can pick up on this and spread this information out as well which is dangerous.  </p>
                
                <p>
                  This is especially dangerous within children and younger people who are in the process of discovering their sexuality, forming their own opinions and discovering who they are. “Their attitudes toward women and men, their present and future conduct and roles are being strongly influenced by Internet content. Certain online services and easily available violent and sexist material can also put them at risk” (Council of Europe)</p>
      
                <p>
                  The misinformation from the digital inequalities can put their right to freedom expression and personal growth to a halt as the negative content provides for some damaging effects. In return, the strong beliefs of the misinformed AI can also negatively influence a child in believing the information created. Ai has a stereotype itself, especially amongst younger audiences to be always right. Younger people majority of the time will believe anything they see online, and if AI spreads negativity, the children could pick up on it and begin condoning that behaviour. </p>
      
                <p>
                  However, not everything can be a matter of misinformation. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Weaponization, yet another factor within the CAIS, AI risks. As we know, “Malicious actors could repurpose AI to be highly destructive, presenting an existential risk in and of itself and increasing the probability of political destabilization.” (Center for AI Safety) Whilst it can be weaponized physically, I will look more at the mental aspect of it. Just like how AI can spread misinformation on stereotypes and strong negative beliefs, it can also be weaponized to enforce them. We know that every country and its people have certain beliefs. Some positive, but some also negative. 

              </p>
    
              <p>
                Diving deeper into digital inequality, we can look at the universal access divide within. This is when certain type of people cannot or do not have access to the latest resources and technology. Since technology is becoming so prominent within this day and age, it is becoming a competition as “political leaders see the strategic advantage in having the most intelligent, most powerful AI systems.” (Center for AI Safety, 8 Examples of AI Risk)
              </p>

              <p>
                Countries are constantly upgrading their technological equipment so that they can be further advanced than the rest, as this would give them much more power and advantage. However, this can also get very expensive, and struggling countries will be limited in acquiring these newer models. This is where the universal access divide comes into play as those in power, will continue to be in power through their technological advances, and those who aren’t in power cannot afford the means to “upgrade” and give them power. This is where AI can be used as weaponization as those countries in power with their powerful AI systems can begin to target and challenge those with lesser or no systems at all. 

              </p>

              <p>
                An example of this can be seen within an event that happened way back in 1879, within the Zulu War. Jihoon Seo talks about how an example of a technological gap can be seen within how the Zulu warriors and how their primary weapon consisted that of a dagger and shield. Comparing to the British soldiers, who wielded a Martini-Henry rifle. “Technology prevailed upon the tribesmen.” (Seo, 2021) 

              </p>

              <p>
                Even though this is a physical example of something that has nothing to do with AI, it is the perfect example in showcasing how countries that are less fortunate (aka the Zulus) and have little to no access to the newer technologies and ai systems. These countries only have their daggers and are put at a huge disadvantage when challenged against those with rifles, in this case being countries with power and better technological gain (aka the British soldiers). 

              </p>

              <p>
                These are just a few examples on why AI can be so destructive, and one of the many reasons on why CSIA have created their letter and made such well-known leaders sign it. If we do not become aware of these problems and control them, it will open up for AI systems to create harmful consequences. The WWW is already a place where cyberspace is created, therefore “transforming society, business, and politics as people respond to new opportunities online and change their behaviour accordingly.” (Lewis, 2021) As already mentioned, countries, people are trying to keep up with the upgraded models to support and upgrade their access to the internet and its benefits. Looking at another one of CSIA’s AI risks, being Power seeking behaviour. It is mentioned how “Companies and governments have strong economic incentives to create agents that can accomplish a broad set of goals.” (Center for AI Safety, 8 Examples of AI Risk)

              </p>

              <p>
                With this goal in mind, people set to create and upgrade to technological devices set to accomplish certain tasks better than before. It is a continuous competition seeking who can acquire the better technology which will offer multiple advantages. Company wise, it’s a competition between who can have the better performance, create the better product all whilst putting in minimal effort. Political wise its based on who has the better technology for the sake of gaining better information, gaining power and having control over those without. All this competition creates an environment where AI is continuously upgraded and advanced in order to achieve even greater results than before. This creates yet another problem in which us humans risk creating such complex AI, that in return might not be able to be controlled anymore. If we give something more power than we have, we will struggle to contain it. 

              </p>

              <p>
                Unfortunately, as Vladimir Putin quotes, “Whoever becomes the leader in [AI] will become the ruler of the world.” Has created such an intensive competition within this world in which countries continuously aim to create better systems in order to gain more power. Already now, ChatGPT has been created, which basically replaces the need to research, read and do many tasks. Even though it comes with its faults like spoken about before, it is already a step in the direction of creating AI that could become more powerful than the creators themselves. We have already begun creating systems in which replace the need for human interaction and labour, and with the intensive power seeking our world has, people only look to further build and improve these systems to create something better, something more powerful. This is very dangerous, as slowly but surely, we are being replaced by the technology we create. 

              </p>

              <p>
                This is why CSIA have created this letter and gathered all of these AI leaders to sign the statement. They hope that this will bring awareness to the many risks of mishandling AI. This of course, does not mean any change will be made about stopping AI mishandling, but it does help bring us light on that even the creators themselves, have their concerns. Hopefully, this will at least aid us into realizing that even though AI has its many wonders, we should tread lightly with how much power we give it.
