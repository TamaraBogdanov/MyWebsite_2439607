            <h1>Heres a bit about myself..</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>Im currently studying Digital Arts at the University of Witswaterstrand. <br/> 
                Ive selected to major in Interactive Media as well as<br/> Writing and  
                Interactivity to better aid me in achieving my goal of becomming
                 a successful web designer. <br/> 
                <br/> 
                <br/>
                I am relatively new to the coding side of things as i am mainly artistic, <br/> 
                but i have found it rather interesting and i enjoy mixing my artistic side 
                with logical thinking. <br/> 
                I am a quick learner and won't shy away from a challenge.
