            <h1>Heres a bit about myself..</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>Im currently studying Digital Arts at the University of Witswaterstrand. <br/> 
                Ive selected to major in Interactive Media as well as<br/> Writing and  
                Interactivity to better aid me in achieving my goal of becomming
                 a successful web designer. <br/> 
                <br/> 
                <br/>
                I am relatively new to the coding side of things as i am mainly artistic, <br/> 
                but i have found it rather interesting and i enjoy mixing my artistic side 
                with logical thinking. <br/> 
                I am a quick learner and won't shy away from a challenge.

            My  <b><span style="color: #009688;"> Interests! </span> </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            I have decided to take Digital Arts at Wits mainly because of my immense love for gaming. I have always loved playing video games 
            and it was always my dream to work in that environment. Not only that but i have a huge interest in IT and anything involving it!

          </p>
          <p>
            I spend a lot of my time researching and discovering new things to do with the www. I am involved in it greatly and i feel that i need 
            to be in a working environment that will only amplify this.
