        Similar elements as the first Iteration, except i have decided to move
        the photo of myself to the ABOUT page as i felt it would be more fitting. 
        <br/><br/>Instead i have decided to just keep it at a minimal and explain
        what my website is about. The navbar is my most important element as it
        navigates the user to all my different sections.</b><br/>
        <br/>It is short and sweet,
        If you want to see my work, click below, if you want to see about me and
        my Blogs everything is navigated in the navbar for easy access. This is
        why i decided to keep my homepage simple. I do not want the user to
        become confused or for it to be a clutter of information as the
        homepage is the most important page, its whats draws the user in and a
         messsy homepage would send them running.

          I have decided to create some more space as i felt that adding my portfolio images as well as about image and info would clutter the page
          too much. <br/><br/>
          Therefore, in my final i have seperated the two into two pages to create a more neater effect. This way the page wouldnt
          be an information overload to the user. There is a lot of space for the userto breathe. I have also decided to center my paragraph
          as it appeared neater this way, as well as to fit the reaccuring theme of centering my paragraphs throughout my website so i can
          stay consistent.<br/><br/>
          As per every page, navbar and logo remain to achieve a consistent neat effect and to help user navigae with ease back and fourth 
          through pages.

        <p>
          The biggest change i have made was completely redoing the structure of my blog posts. Originally, it would have been the 5 links
          to the blog posts with week 1s blog post immediately starting underneath that. This made my page look very boring and just full of
          writing which is a very bad design choice.<br/> <br/>
           Due to this i have decided to structure it similarly to my about page..have a heading and 
          paragraph in the middle, explaining what this page is about. I have then decided to move the 5 links directly underneath that.
          This design choice made it appear much neater.<br/> <br/> On the next page, is then where the first blog post would begin.
           Originally, i added a
          rounded border as the background to my blog text, there were also margins added to center this block. However, 
          this ended up looking more like a powerpoint slide, it was also boring and plain.So, instead i decided to add a different transparent
          image per week for the text to neatly sit atop. I have also removed the bordered effect and margins as it looked neater and more modern 
          that way.<br/> <br/>
           I also made the text smaller so everyblog post could directly fit into a page, and there would be no overlap with other blog posts.

        <h2>My <b><span style="color: #009687a3 ;">Final</b></span> page included:</h2>
        <p>
         I have decided to add the navbar and logo back as it flt off having a page without it. Not only was it not consistent but also
         how would users navigate back to the other pages? They would have to instead click the "back" button and this was not efficient at all.
         
         To again, fit the consistency and neatness i have dedicated the first page as a neat layout of whats to be expected as well as a line
         of links taking you to sections within that document, just like how i did it with the blog posts. <br/><br/>
          I tried my best to create consistent
         and neat layouts as the document expanded but due to the shear load of information i had to put in, nothing really worked well. I have
         stuck to using layouts and structures based off of my other pages to keep the same flow. Even so, as you would scroll down it became very
         bland as there were just a lot of words and the same turqoise colour i always use.<br/><br/>
          Due to the lack of time i was unable to really 
         experiment with the design doc to give it a much more unique, interesting layout. Even though my layouts work well in terms of
         neatness and consistency for the amount of 
         content i had to add, it could still be way better as at the moment it doesnt have a website feel.

        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <p>
         Overall, my objective wass to go for a simplistic, modern look. Something thats easy to read and easy on the eye. 
         For that reason i have decided to stick with the Sans Serif font, purely because research has also grading this font one of the best 
         for websites.<br/><br/>
          I have decided to make majority of my text white and turqoise as my background was darker. Throughout my website
         i have the same reoccuring transparent image present as the basis for many pages, the white and turqoise creates a nice contrast between
         this and stands out, without straining the eye. It makes the readability of my website much better.<br/><br/>
          Once the user would then scroll down
         thats when they would be met with a white background, here is where i would manipulate my use of semantic markup to create blocks of
         colour and pictures so that my website doesnt now appear plain. The same turqoise was prominent but ive changed the text not to black as white
         would hurt my eyes upon reading, as the theme was too bright. <br/><br/>

         For my layouts, to best achieve this modern apeal ive stuck with putting as little as possible on the main pages. Ive structured my pages so that the text would mainly
         sit in the center, better achiving this modern, neat effect. <br/><br/>
         I have also used bigger font size in this case, so that the users attention would be immediately grabbed by whats in front of 
         them, and where they would like to go.
          When the text was on the left or right, it would look out of place as i 
         wouldnt right a lot on my main pages, so center is what worked best. <br/><br/>
         Only later on, as my blog posts and design doc were beigh created is when
         i made use of a lot of white space, still giving the user some time to breathe by making use of the semantic banners and pictures i mentioned earlier.
         <br/><br/>
         I also decided to keep my navbar and logo throughout every page not only because this is what majority of websites have, but because this is 
         the users main way of interaction. They can switch between pages as they please. The secondary form of interaction was my links, and however 
         i created links that would take the user to certain points on he page, especially of that section/page included a lot of information. 
         This made it easier for the user to navigate. <br/><br/>

         Throughout my website, it remains consistent. The same layout was used throughout. I kept the main pages all similar with that centered effect
         and as you scrolled down there was always white space mixed with turqoise banners, and sometimes images as backgrounds as can be seen in my blog posts.
         <br/><br/>
         Ive created unique pages that still contain the same theme throughout. My biggest issue however was dealing with the design doc as the 
         information overload made it difficult to structure and layout it accordingly. A lot of my structuring here reminded me of powerpoint slides.
         I have also realized that i hardcode a lot of my texts and images so,
         when displayed on a different sized monitor it shifts position. This is something i will work on in future

        <h2>My Flow Chart</h2>
        <p>Ive made a very complex flow chat for my quite simple website.Im not the strongest in creating flow diagrams but i 
          believe i have made a good enough user flow that basically gives someone a sense of how my website works. Itn not structured very well\
          but i have included all interactions and flow of my website within.
        </p>

        <h2>Code Interactivity</h2>
        <p>Hy UI/UX throughout has remainded consistent and therefore a lot of my code has been the same for certain elements.<br/><br/>
           I have 
          had to reuse a lot of the same CSS code to create the same effects on different pages, in order to remaim consistent. My CSS styling page is very long,
          not only because of this but also because i had trouble with the semantic markup within html, i created too many containers and 
          its what made me have to create many different CSS classes etc. <br/><br/>

          My html was also pretty similar. I used a lot of divs, articles and sections. Divs i would mainly use to structure and group a 
          certain element of little to no importance, 
          Sections i used to group a larger more meaningful element and Articles i used to group large important bodies of text.<br/><br/>
          All of this grouping, 
          while tedious did help me create lot of interesting sections as i was able to manipulate the semantic markup to achieve effects i desired. 
          <br/><br/>I also need to fix on my css editing as i noticed that i add a lot of uneccessary information in, and forget to remove it when experimenting.
          Upon sending out my website to my peers for them to test it, ive also noticed that due to my hardcoding of margins, text and images have a tendency of 
          slightly shifting

        <h2 id="MyGoals">My <b><span style="color: #009687a3 ;">Goals</b></span> for the website:</h2>
        <p>
          My biggest goal was to create an easy to read, modern look, which i think i have done pretty well achieving, however a goal i have for next time
          would be to figure out how to apply this same effect to my design doc to create a more modern website feel, instead of a plain, powerpoint looking one.
          <br/><br/>
          Overall my biggest goal was to be able to write this website on my own, last year we were heavily reliant on YouTube to create something
          of our games as we didnt understand what to do and how to tackle scenarios. Thanks to the help of the readings, lectures and my research 
          i was able to approach this project differntly and it made it not only a lot easier for me to understand what im doing but easier for me to actually
          do the work.<br/><br/>
           As ive been practicing my website ive been improving so much and thanks to the consistency ive created within my web, i got a lot
          of practice in some fields, which i am fully able to create on my own now. I have also improved so much with semantic markup but one goal
          i definetly have for future is to try neaten my use of it. I have a habit of creating too many containers that i get lost in my own work.
          My style sheet is also huge because of this, i need to learn how to properly use them and group them so i do not need to create 
           a container for everything.<br/><br/> 

          I am excited to keep working on this website and tackle different elements, i hope to learn many more things. My biggest goals
          are to minimize my use of uneccessary semantic markup and to improve in my coding structure in both html and css as often i add in a lot of information whilst editing, and forget to remove it.
