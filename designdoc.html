      <p>
        Similar elements as the first Iteration, except i have decided to move
        the photo of myself to the ABOUT page as i felt it would be more fitting. 
      </p>
      <p>Instead i have decided to just keep it at a minimal and explain
        what my website is about. The navbar is my most important element as it
        navigates the user to all my different sections.</p>
        <p>It is short and sweet,
        If you want to see my work, click below, if you want to see about me and
        my Blogs everything is navigated in the navbar for easy access. This is
        why i decided to keep my homepage simple. I do not want the user to
        become confused or for it to be a clutter of information as the
        homepage is the most important page, its whats draws the user in and a
         messsy homepage would send them running.

         I have also added in two more links to the navbar, being the essay and design sections. This was it can be accessed at any time and 
         there wont be any need to constantly go back to the homepage to view them. 
         I have also made my navbar a solid green colour since it is now fixed. The green nicely compliments the back as well as the other colours of 
         the website.

          I have decided to create some more space as i felt that adding my portfolio images as well as about image and info would clutter the page
          too much. </p>
          <p>
          Therefore, in my final i have seperated the two into two pages to create a more neater effect. This way the page wouldnt
          be an information overload to the user. There is a lot of space for the userto breathe. I have also decided to center my paragraph
          as it appeared neater this way, as well as to fit the reaccuring theme of centering my paragraphs throughout my website so i can
          stay consistent.</p> <p>
          As per every page, navbar and logo remain to achieve a consistent neat effect and to help user navigae with ease back and fourth 
          through pages.
        I have not changed much since but the addition of the coloured navbar and a few additional text as i have added majority of the portfolio 
        inforation in the first assignment.</p>

        <p>
          I have completely redone my blog section by using an accordion function. </p>
           <p>
           I have decided to change this as i found that making links for huge essay bodies of text whilst efficient, made my page just too lengthy
          and ugly. All of the bodies of text one after another just made for a boring page. On top of that you had to constantly scroll up
        to go back or scroll down to read more.</p>
          <p>
           With the accordion, the page looks much neater and it makes it much more inviting to read as well. It also looks much more visually appealing. 
           I have made it so the code only opens one blog post at a time. So if you would click on week two, then week three, week two would now automatically close.
           Ive done this to create a neater environment and not bombard my page with text.

           As per every page, it comes with the fixed green navbar for easier access.

        <p>
         I have decided to add the navbar and logo back as it flt off having a page without it. Not only was it not consistent but also
         how would users navigate back to the other pages? They would have to instead click the "back" button and this was not efficient at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         To again, fit the consistency and neatness i have dedicated the first page as a neat layout of whats to be expected as well as a line
         of links taking you to sections within that document, just like how i did it with the blog posts. I have also fixed the original navbar to be fixed 
        so that when users are scrolling through the document they can easily click to navigate throughout the pages or go to the top of the design doc.</p>
         <p>
          I tried my best to create consistent
         and neat layouts as the document expanded but due to the shear load of information i had to put in, nothing really worked well. I have
         stuck to using layouts and structures based off of my other pages to keep the same flow. Even so, as you would scroll down it became very
         bland as there were just a lot of words and the same turqoise colour i always use. To counter this i broke up many of the sections with 
        white space and imagery</p>
         <p>
         I have also added a new link at the top of the design doc page to take you down to my journey on the responsive design. 
         I wanted to originally change my design doc to have a similar layout to that of my blog posts but due to all the shear amount of information 
         ive decided to keep this layout. Whilst it is still sloppy, it works for now especially since ive added a fixed navbar so the user isnt stuck 
         scrolling up and down for information.

         Whilst it definetly looks like a downgrade from the first wireframe, i have decided to do nothing fancy with it because there was only
         one essay at the moment. I was experimenting with several layouts. First being the use of the scroll box for each side, then i thought of only adding 
         in one scroll box for the one essay but i thought that was dumb as you can just already scroll on the side of the page anyways. There was no need to do this.
         For this reason i have just decided to have a simple layout like my blogposts. No fancy background or anything. A simple coloured background with
         a white background text for the essay. I did this to match consistently with my blog page as it also includes a greenish background with
         white for the accordion.

      <article class="designdocStyle">
        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <p>
         Overall, my objective wass to go for a simplistic, modern look. Something thats easy to read and easy on the eye. 
         For that reason i have decided to stick with the Sans Serif font, purely because research has also grading this font one of the best 
         for websites. </p>
         <p>
          I have decided to make majority of my text white and turqoise as my background was darker. Throughout my website
         i have the same reoccuring transparent image present as the basis for many pages, the white and turqoise creates a nice contrast between
         this and stands out, without straining the eye. It makes the readability of my website much better.</p>
         <p>
          Once the user would then scroll down
         thats when they would be met with a white background, here is where i would manipulate my use of semantic markup to create blocks of
         colour and pictures so that my website doesnt now appear plain. The same turqoise was prominent but ive changed the text not to black as white
         would hurt my eyes upon reading, as the theme was too bright. I have also added in a fixed nav with a dark green solid background. Since majority of my
        website consists of three colours, green, black and white i have decided to make the navbar a darker green so when i scroll down, it stands out from the rest and doesnt blend into the 
        existing green and create eye strain. The fixed element also allows for easier access as the user scrolls down.</p>
         <p>

         For my layouts, to best achieve this modern apeal ive stuck with putting as little as possible on the main pages. Ive structured my pages so that the text would mainly
         sit in the center, better achiving this modern, neat effect. </p>
         <p>
         I have also used bigger font size in this case, so that the users attention would be immediately grabbed by whats in front of 
         them, and where they would like to go.
          When the text was on the left or right, it would look out of place as i 
         wouldnt right a lot on my main pages, so center is what worked best.</p>
         <p>
         Only later on, as my blog posts and design doc were beigh created is when
         i made use of a lot of white space, still giving the user some time to breathe by making use of the semantic banners and pictures i mentioned earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also decided to keep my navbar and logo throughout every page not only because this is what majority of websites have, but because this is 
         the users main way of interaction. They can switch between pages as they please. The secondary form of interaction was my links, and however 
         i created links that would take the user to certain points on he page, especially of that section/page included a lot of information. 
         This made it easier for the user to navigate. </p>
        <p>
         Throughout my website, it remains consistent. The same layout was used throughout. I kept the main pages all similar with that centered effect
         and as you scrolled down there was always white space mixed with turqoise banners, and sometimes images as backgrounds as can be seen in my blog posts.
        </p>
      <p>
         Ive created unique pages that still contain the same theme throughout. My biggest issue however was dealing with the design doc as the 
         information overload made it difficult to structure and layout it accordingly. A lot of my structuring here reminded me of powerpoint slides.
         I have also realized that i hardcode a lot of my texts and images so,
         when displayed on a different sized monitor it shifts position. I have combated this by adding a fixed nav to the website so even when scrolling down
         all that information, you can just go back to any page at any time. I was hoping to structure my design doc similarily to how to structures my blog posts, 
         with the accordion but decided against this. Its unique in its own way and there is too much information that if i had also made it ac accordion
         it would just be one long boring page of white blocks that you can expand. 
        </p>

        <p>
          With the addition of a new blog page, i have decided to keep it short and simple by just creating a coloured background, and adding a white
          accordion over that. All of my other pages always start off with the transparent image as the background so for this case, since it is an accordion
          i have just stuck with a plain background so it doesnt look weird switching from image, to plain background behind the accordion. This would also help my websites
          performance as the old blog page came with a handful of images i set as backgrounds, which i do not have a need for anymore. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition my new essays page has also adopted a similar style. In assignment one i have structured it with that same transparent image in the 
          background but since my whole page will be dedicated to one block of text, i have decided the plain greenish blue background with a white box for the text will
          look better, and aid my website in being more consistent.

          not only because of this but also because i had trouble with the semantic markup within html, i created too many containers and 
          its what made me have to create many different CSS classes etc. </p>
          <p>
          My html was also pretty similar. I originally used a lot of divs and a few articles and sections. However now i have updated my semantic markup and 
          added multiple more like nav/ header/ container as well as reduced the usage of divs.
          With these groupings i was able to create sections to group large important bodies of text and add visual elements to them.</p>
          <p>
          All of this grouping, 
          while tedious did help me create lot of interesting sections as i was able to manipulate the semantic markup to achieve effects i desired. I did however notice that
            even though i grouped everything to achieve these effects, they were grouped together very sloppy. I had multiple uneccessary grouping 
            elements within one container, and majority was always just divs. 
            I have changed my semantic markup a lot by not only changing majority of the divs but slightly organizing the grouping so there isnt irrelevant information. 
            I still have a lot of work to do in these aspects as my grouping and CSS can be very confusing.
        </p>
        
        <p>In addition to this i have also added JS functions to completely restructure my blog posts section. I feel that i have used my functions well
          in creating an interactive accordion for the users to play around with. I was going to add JS functionality to my favbar, but i couldnt figure out a 
          way to do this without messing up my code so i have just decided to make the navbar fixed. That way when users scroll through long pages
          such as the design section and blog posts, they can opt out anytime they want.

          Making my device responsive was a weird journey. I started it off by just changing all of the hard coded values in my CSS to 
          rem. % etc and i thought that this would scale down automatically with the device adjustments. It definetly helped, but my 
          website still looked very weird. There were huge empty spaces when opening it up on a mobile device. I spent my time trying to
          change this by scaling the boxes but nothing worked. I went to youtube then and remembered that i need to use meda queries!

          As you can see by the two examples (iphone SE) I have micely manipulated the content to fit on the page. The fixed navbar and 
          logo remain the same on each page. I have decided to keep the navbar like this because i felt like it would look to plain if i added a menu. 

          The text and links all fit nicely on the main menu. Further down however, i have a bit of spacing problems and shifts within my Design Doc. My main menus for 
          both my blog and essay isnt like the rest as it doesnt all fit nicely on one screen. Another issue i have is that my navbar glitches in the design doc and removed the contacts and design doc link itself on mobile.  But none the less, for my first time doing this i dont think it looks that bad. 

          I was only able to manipulate the site to fit well on mobile devices, on ipads and tablets whilst it works slightly, there are still a lot of issues.

        <h2 id="MyGoals">My <b><span style="color: #009687a3 ;">Goals</b></span> for the website:</h2>
        <p>
          My biggest goal was to create an easy to read, modern look, which i think i have done pretty well achieving, however a goal i have for next time
          would be to figure out how to apply this same effect to my design doc to create a more modern website feel, instead of a plain, powerpoint looking one.
          <br/><br/>
          Overall my biggest goal was to be able to write this website on my own, last year we were heavily reliant on YouTube to create something
          of our games as we didnt understand what to do and how to tackle scenarios. Thanks to the help of the readings, lectures and my research 
          i was able to approach this project differntly and it made it not only a lot easier for me to understand what im doing but easier for me to actually
          do the work.<br/><br/>
           As ive been practicing my website ive been improving so much and thanks to the consistency ive created within my web, i got a lot
          of practice in some fields, which i am fully able to create on my own now. I have also improved so much with semantic markup but one goal
          i definetly have for future is to try neaten my use of it. I have a habit of creating too many containers that i get lost in my own work.
          My style sheet is also huge because of this, i need to learn how to properly use them and group them so i do not need to create 
           a container for everything.<br/><br/> 

          I am excited to keep working on this website and tackle different elements, i hope to learn many more things. I have already learnt so much from my previous 
          journey. I thought my website for assignment one was perfect, but i was quickly proved wrong when i got the results back. 
          There were many things i needed to fix, and it was satisfying fixing these errors and improving my website. With the addition of javaScript it also enabled 
          me to create a cool and interactive blog posts page which i am proud of. 

          I still however have a lot to work on. Throughout this journey i have discovered that i still have problems with consistent grouping. I have a tendency of 
          creating many irrelevant groups and in return, my CSS doc is huge. I also need to work more on the javaScript side of things as i still find it pretty challenging 
          to create functions completely from scratch, i always need aid from the internet.
